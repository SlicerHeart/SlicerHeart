# **Annulus Shape Analyzer Module**

This tool allows the population-wise observation of dynamic annulus shape. 

## Features 
1. Procrustes Alignment and Mean Shape Generation
2. PCA Evaluation
3. Shape Regression based on Demographics
4. Single Curve Comparisons

### We've included a healthy pediatric dataset of mitral annuli (MA) contours. This sample ranges from patient ages 0 to 22. 
In the _Mean Shape Files_ there are six contour .csv files.
1. MA Contour Points for Ages 0-1
2. MA Contour Points for Ages 1-5
3. MA Contour Points for Ages 5-9
4. MA Contour Points for Ages 9-13
5. MA Contour Points for Ages 13 and up
6. MA Contour Points for All Ages

This break down is to allow for specific and broad comparisons to users' own pediatric mitral annulus data.

A corresponding demographics file for shape regression is also included as _Boston_Mitral_DemographicsREAL.csv_.
### Data is in Testing Data Folder.
