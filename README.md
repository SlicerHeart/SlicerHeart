# SlicerHeart extension for 3D Slicer

SlicerHeart extension contains tools for cardiac image import (3D/4D ultrasound, CT, MRI), quantification, surgical planning, and implant placement planning and assessment.

The extension currently includes the following features (new features are added continuously):
- [Cardiac image import and export](Docs/ImageImportExport.md):
  - DICOM ultrasound image importer plugins: they allow loading Philips Affinity 3D ultrasound images, GE 3D ultrasound images and 2D image sequences, Eigen Artemis 3D ultrasound images, and some Siemens, Samsung, Canon, and Hitachi 3D ultrasound images.
  - [Philips 4D US DICOM patcher](Docs/Philips4dUsDicomPatcher.md): Cartesian 4D echo images exported by Philips QLAB are not valid DICOM files. This module fixes the files and makes them loadable into 3D Slicer.
  - [Reconstruct 4D cine-MRI](Docs/Reconstruct4DCineMRI.md): Reconstruct sequence of Cartesian volumes from a sparse set of cine-MRI frames.
  - Carto Export: export models to to be used in Carto EP mapping systems.
  - TomTec UCD data file importer: allows loading *.UCD.data.zip file as a model sequence. When drag-and-dropping the zip file to the application window, then choose "No" to the question "The selected file is a zip archive, open it and load contents" and then click OK in the displayed "Add data..." window.
- Cardiac image visualization:
  - Echo Volume Render: module for display of 3D/4D cardiac ultrasound images with distance-dependent coloring.
  - Valve View: module for visualization of heart valves: allows reslicing the volume using two rotating orthogonal planes. This feature is mainly for Slicer-4.10, as in Slicer-4.11 and later, this feature is built into Slicer core (enable slice intersections and Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + Left-click-and drag to rotate slice view).
- Quantification:
  - Valve annulus analysis: specify basic heart valve properties and annulus contour.
  - Valve segmentation: module for volumetric segmentation of heart valves.
  - Leaflet analysis: create valve leaflet surface models from volmetric valve segmentation.
  - Valve papillary analysis: allow specify papillary muscles and chords to compute angles and lengths.
  - [Valve quantification](Docs/ValveQuantification.md): automatic computation heart valve annulus, leaflet, and papillary metrics
  - Valve batch export: run valve quantification and export results for a large cohort of data.
  - [Orifice area](Docs/OrificeArea.md): measure cross-sectional area of openings in a model, for example to quantify regurgitant orifice area.
  - [Annular Shape Analyzer](Docs/AnnularShapeAnalyzer.md): make population-wise observations on dynamic annular shape.
  - [Fluoro Flow Calculator](Docs/FluoroFlowCalculator.md): measuring Qp-split using readily available fluoroscopy sequences.
- Implant placement planning and assessment:
  - Cardiac Device Simulator: module for evaluating placement of cardiac implants. Shows all cardiac device models (Harmony device, generic cylindrical device, various ASD/VSD devices) and all available analysis tools.
  - [ASD/VSD Device Simulator](Docs/AsdVsdDeviceSimulator.md): cardiac device  simulator for ASD/VSD device placement analysis.
  - TCAV Valve Simulator
  - ValveClip Device Simulator
  - Leaflet Mold Generator: tool for automatic generation of 3D-printable molds for making simulated valves out of silicone.
- Surgical planning:
  - [Baffle planner](Docs/BafflePlanner.md): modeling tool for virtual planning of intracardiac baffle - or any other thin curved surfaces in any clinical specialties (for example, cranial flaps).
